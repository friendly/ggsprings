Description: ggsprings implements an extension of "geom_path"" which draws paths as springs instead of straight lines.
    Aside from possible artistic use, the main impetus for this is to draw points connected by springs,
    with properties of length and tension, for use in illustrating least squares problems such as the sample mean,
    mutivariate centroid, linear and non-linear regression and
    principal components analysis.
