## Introduction

The method of least squares fitting is remarkable in its versatility. It grew out of practical problems in astronomy
(the orbits of planets, librations of the moon) and geodesy (finding the "shape" of the earth), where astronomers and mathematicians sought
to find a way to combine a collection of fallible observations (angular separation between stars) into a
a single "best" estimate. Some of the best names in mathematics are associated with this discovery:
Newton, Laplace, Legendre, Gauss. @Stigler1981 recounts some of this history.

It's original application was to justify the use of the arithmetic average $\bar{x}$ as the value
that gave the smallest sum of squares of errors $\text{SSE} =\Sigma (x - \bar{x})^2$, but the same principle
gives solutions for linear least squares regression, multiple regression, smoothing splines and non-linear models,
all the way to exploratory factor analysis.

As a mathematical method of estimation, least squares is also remarkably versatile in the variety of methods of proof
that can justify it's application. Minimization of the sum of squares of errors can be solved by calculus or
by a simple geometric argument. It is the purpose of this vignette to show how least squares problems can be
solved by springs. No need to invoke a function minimization algorithm or solve a system of equations. Just
connect your observations to what you want to estimate with springs, and _bingo!_, let the springs give the answer.

# A mechanical solution
Among the earliest demonstrations of solving least squares problems by springs, @GainesPalphrey:1932
included the following figures to illustrate a remarkable physical device for
fitting a linear relation $y = a + b x$ to observations. In the left figure, seven uniform springs placed at $x = 0 : 6$
are suspended
from the observed values $y_i = 5$ and from these light bands are connected to a heavy stepped plumb wheel. The dotted horizontal
line represented the least squares fit; it goes through the mean $\bar{y} = 5$ and has the equation $\hat{y} = 5 + 0 x$.
The number gauge at the left allows one to read the intercept, $a = 5$ and from the scale markings on the wheel
one can read the slope, $b = 0$.

```{r}
#| label: fig-Gaines-fig2
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "60%"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Diagrams to illustrate the use of springs in fitting a linear regression relation. Left: all observed $y$
#|       values are the same ($y = 5$); right: $y_i = \\{9, 6, 8, 4, 4, 1, 3\\}$. The equation of the line can be read
#|       from the scale at the left for the intercept and the scale on the wheel for the slope."
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("man/figures/Gaines-fig2.png"))
```

In the figure at the right the $y$ values are $y_i = \{9, 6, 8, 4, 4, 1, 3\}$ which has the same sum, $\Sigma y = 35$
The dotted fitted line again passes through the mean $\bar{y} = 5$. The springs connecting the points to the fitted
line are stretched or compressed by their deviations, $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}$, and for equilibrium these
deviations must sum to zero, $\Sigma e_i = 0$. Each spring stores potential energy proportional to $e_i^2$ and
the system is in equilibrium when the sum of energies, $\Sigma e_i^2$ is at its minimum.

For this problem, `lm()` gives $\hat{y} = 8.43 - 1.143 \;x$ and these values can be read approximately from the device.

```{r}
x <- 0:6
y <- c(9, 6, 8, 4, 4, 1, 3)
lm(y~x) |> coef()
```

In reaching equilibrium, the weighted wheel is rotated through an angle proportional to the slope, $b$,
whose value is shown on the scale for the wheel. The intercept is the value shown on the scale at the left for the
line at $x=0$.

Thus, the spring diagram illustrates mechanically the properties of the least squares solution:

1. The fitted line passes through the central value $\bar{x}$ at the value of the mean $\bar{y}$ of the $y_i$.
2. The algebraic sum of the deviations from the line is zero, $\Sigma e_i = \Sigma (y_i - \bar{y}) = 0$.
3. The sum of squares of the deviations $\Sigma e_i^2$ is minimum.

## Hooke's Law, potential energy and force

The application of springs to problems in statistics depends on understanding the physics of springs
and physical systems more generally, using the concepts of potential energy, forces applied by physical
objects and how these can balance in a state of equilibrium.

### Linear springs
A linear spring is the one whose tension
is directly proportional to its length: stretching such a spring
to a length $x$ requires the force $F(x) = k\;x$. Force acts in a given direction, so compressing a spring
requires a force $- k\;x$. This is illustrated in the figure below, where $x$ indicates the stretching of a spring.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hookes-law
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "50%"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Hooke's Law for springs. The force required to stretch the spring is proportional to the extension, $x$, represented by the weights. _Source_: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law)"
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("man/figures/Hookes-law-springs.png"))
```


Here the multiplier $k$ is a constant (called the Hookeâ€™s constant) that characterizes a particular spring. A small $k$
means a lax spring, while a large $k$ means a stiff spring. By convention, the unstretched length of such a spring is zero.

In the ggSprings package to date, all observations are considered to have the same, arbitrary spring constant. Allowing these
to vary, with a `weight` aesthetic would be a natural way to implement weighted least squares.

### Functions, energy, force

A spring is something that acts elastically, meaning that it stores (potential) energy if you either stretch it or compress it. How much energy it stores is proportional to the square of the
distance it is stretched or compressed.

$$
P(x) = \frac12 k \; x^2
$$
In this notation, the force exerted by a spring, $F(x)$ can be seen as the (negative) derivative, or slope at $x$
of potential energy,

$$
F(x) = -\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac12 k \; x^2 \right)= -k \; x
$$
A spring is at equilibrium when the potential energy is minimized, or the force exerted is zero.
The general relations between mathematics and physics are shown in the table below [@Levi2009, p.27].

```{r echo = FALSE}
tbl <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Mathematics,   ~Physics,
  "function, $f (x)$",          "potential energy, $P(x)$",
  "derivative, $f\\prime (x)$",  "force, $F(x) = -P\\prime(x)$",
  "$\\min_x f(x) \\implies f\\prime (x) = 0$",
          "equilibrium, $\\min_x P(x) \\implies F (x) = 0$"
  )

tt(tbl)
```

These relations are illustrated in the figure below, where positive $x$ means the spring is stretched and negative $x$
represents compression. When the spring is stretched to $x = 3$, the potential energy is $P(x) = \frac12 (3^2) = 4.5$.
The line through $(3, 4.5)$ tangent to the curve has slope 
$P^\prime (x) = x = 3$
so the force the spring exerts is $F(x) = -3$, where the negative sign means a force in the direction of $x=0$.

k <- 1/2
x <- seq(-6, 6, 0.5)
Px <- k * x^2

linepts <- function(a, b, x) {
  y <- a + b * x
  data.frame(x,y)
}

op <- par(mar = c(4,4,1,1)+.5)
plot(x, Px,
     type = "l",
     lwd = 2,
     axes = FALSE,
     ylab = "",
     cex.lab = 2)

axis(2)
abline(v=0, lwd = 1.2)
text(0, 18, "P(x)", cex = 2, xpd = TRUE)

# line through (3, 4.5), extending from x=2 to x=4
#   slope = d k X^2 / dx = X = 3
#   -> y - 4.5 = 3 * (x - 3) -> y = 3 X - 9
pts <- linepts(-4.5, 3, c(1.5, 3, 4.5))

lines(pts, col = "blue", lwd = 3)
points(pts[2,], pch = 16, cex= 2.3, col = "red")

text(-3, 14, expression(P(x) == frac(1,2) * X^2), cex = 1.2)
text(-2.8, 12, expression(F(x) == 2 * X), cex = 1.2)

points(0, 0, pch = 16, cex= 1.5, col = "red")
segments(x0 = -1.2, x1 = 1.2,
         y0 = 0, y1 = 0, col = "blue", lwd=2)

text(4 + c(0, .5), 6 + c(-0.7, -3),
     c(expression(F(x) == -dP/dx),
       expression(F(x) == - slope[x])),
     cex = 1.4,
     srt = 60,
     col = "blue",
     xpd = TRUE)
par(op)
```

The horizontal line through $(0, 0)$, that is, when $x = 0$ illustrates equilibribum where potential energy
is minimized, and the force (slope) is $F(0) = 0$.

## Mean of a sample


The sample mean has several nice physical analogs, which stem from the properties that 

* the sum of deviations ($e_i$) of observations ($x_i$) from the mean $\bar{x}$ equals 0: $\Sigma_i e_i =\Sigma_i ( x_i - \bar{x} ) = 0$.

* the sum of squared deviations is the smallest for any choice of $\bar{x} = \min_{\bar{x}} ( x_i - \bar{x} )^2$

### Demonstration using springs


Create a set of observations, sampled randomly on [1, 10]
```{r mean1}
set.seed(1234)
N <- 8
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(N, 1, 10),
  y = seq(1, N)
)

means <- colMeans(df) 
xbar <- means[1] |> print()
```

Then, set the tension of the spring to be the absolute value of the deviation of the observation from the mean.
```{r mean2}
df <- df |>
  mutate(tension = abs(x - xbar),
         diameter = 0.2)
```

Then, visualize this with springs: 

```{r mean-springs}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, color = "red") +
  geom_segment(x = xbar, xend = xbar,
               y = 1/2,  yend = N + 1/2,
               linewidth = 3) +
  geom_spring(aes(x = x, xend = xbar,
                  y = y, yend = y,
                  tension = tension,
                  diameter = diameter),
              color = "blue",
              linewidth = 1.2) +
  labs(x = "Value (x)",
       y = "Observation number") +
  ylim(0, N+2) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:N) +
  annotate("text", x = xbar, y = N + 1,
           label = "Movable\nrod", size = 5,
           , lineheight = 3/4) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

## Bivariate centroid

For a bivariate sample, $(x_i, y_i)$, the centroid point, $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ is realized physically as the result of attaching
springs between the fixed points and a free, movable point. If we make the tension on the spring proportional to it's length
or the distance to the centroid,
each point will have potential energy proportional to its **squared** distance
from the movable one, where the forces balance (sum to zero).

Set this up for a sample of 10 points, uniformly distributed on (1, 10).
```{r cent1}
set.seed(1234)
N <- 10
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(N, 1, 10),
  y = runif(N, 1, 10)
)

means <- colMeans(df)
xbar <- means[1]; ybar <- means[2]
```

Set the tension as the distance between the point and the mean:

```{r cent2}
df <- df |>
  mutate(tension = sqrt((x - xbar)^2 + (y - ybar)^2),
         diameter = 0.4)
```

Visualize the springs:

```{r centroid-springs}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, color = "red") +
  geom_spring(aes(x = x, xend = xbar,
                  y = y, yend = ybar,
                  tension = tension / 5,
                  diameter = diameter),
              color = "blue",
              linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(x = xbar, y = ybar, 
             size = 7,
             shape = 15,
             color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:10) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) 
```

### Animate this?

One way to animate this would be to imagine the springs acting one at a time, sequentially on the position of the moving point, and looping until nothing changes. Not sure how to program this with `gganimate`.


## Least squares regression

For linear least squares regression, we have a collection of points $(x_i, y_i)$, and it is desired to fit a 
"best" line $y = a + b \times x$ that makes the sum of squares of errors,
$$
\text{RSS} (a,b) = \Sigma \left[y_i - (a + b \times x_i) \right]^2 = \Sigma e_i^2
$$
as small as possible. The representation by springs is shown
