## Introduction

The method of least squares fitting is remarkable in its versatility. It grew out of practical problems in astronomy
(the orbits of planets, librations of the moon) and geodesy (finding the "shape" of the earth), where astronomers and mathematicians sought
to find a way to combine a collection of fallible observations (angular separation between stars) into a
a single "best" estimate. Some of the best names in mathematics are associated with this discovery:
Newton, Laplace, Legendre, Gauss. @Stigler:1981 recounts some of this history.

It's original application was to justify the use of the arithmetic average $\bar{x}$ as the value
that gave the smallest sum of squares of errors $\text{SSE} =\Sigma (x - \bar{x})^2$, but the same principle
gives solutions for linear least squares regression, multiple regression, smoothing splines and non-linear models,
all the way to exploratory factor analysis.

As a mathematical method of estimation, least squares is also remarkably versatile in the variety of methods of proof
that can justify it's application. Minimization of the sum of squares of errors can be solved by calculus or
by a simple geometric argument. It is the purpose of this vignette to show how least squares problems can be
solved by springs. No need to invoke a function minimization algorithm or solve a system of equations. Just
connect your observations to what you want to estimate with springs, and _bingo!_, let the springs give the answer.

<!-- But first, it useful to -->

## Hooke's Law, potential energy and force

The application of springs to problems in statistics depends on understanding the physics of springs
and physical systems more generally, using the concepts of potential energy, forces applied by physical
objects and how these can balance in a state of equilibrium.

### Linear springs
A linear spring is the one whose tension
is directly proportional to its length: stretching such a spring
to a length $x$ requires the force $F(x) = k\;x$. Force acts in a given direction, so compressing a spring
requires a force $- k\;x$. This is illustrated in the figure below, where $x$ indicates the stretching of a spring.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hookes-law
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "50%"
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("man/figures/Hookes-law-springs.png"))
```


Here the multiplier $k$ is a constant (called the Hookeâ€™s constant) that characterizes a particular spring. A small $k$
means a lax spring, while a large $k$ means a stiff spring. By convention, the unstretched length of such a spring is zero.

In the ggSprings package to date, all observations are considered to have the same, arbitrary spring constant. Allowing these
to vary, with a `weight` aesthetic would be a natural way to implement weighted least squares.

### Functions, energy, force

A spring is something that acts elastically, meaning that it stores (potential) energy if you either stretch it or compress it. How much energy it stores is proportional to the square of the
distance it is stretched or compressed.

$$
P(x) = \frac12 k \; x^2
$$
In this notation, the force exerted by a spring, $F(x)$ can be seen as derivative, or slope at $x$
of potential energy,

$$
F(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac12 k \; x^2 \right)= k \; x
$$

The general relations between mathematics and physics are shown in the table below [@Levi2009, p.27].
```{r echo = FALSE}
tbl <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Mathematics,   ~Physics,
  "function, $f (x)$",          "potential energy, $P(x)$",
  "derivative, $f\\prime (x)$",  "force, $F(x) = -P\\prime(x)$",
  "$\\min_x f(x) \\implies f\\prime (x) = 0$",
          "equilibrium, $\\min_x P(x) \\implies F (x) = 0$"
  )

tt(tbl)
```


## Mean of a sample


The sample mean has several nice physical analogs, which stem from the properties that 

* the sum of deviations ($e_i$) of observations ($x_i$) from the mean $\bar{x}$ equals 0: $\Sigma_i e_i =\Sigma_i ( x_i - \bar{x} ) = 0$.

* the sum of squared deviations is the smallest for any choice of $\bar{x} = \min_{\bar{x}} ( x_i - \bar{x} )^2$

### Demonstration using springs


Create a set of observations, sampled randomly on [1, 10]
```{r mean1}
set.seed(1234)
N <- 8
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(N, 1, 10),
  y = seq(1, N)
)

means <- colMeans(df) 
xbar <- means[1] |> print()
```

Then, set the tension of the spring to be the absolute value of the deviation of the observation from the mean.
```{r mean2}
df <- df |>
  mutate(tension = abs(x - xbar),
         diameter = 0.2)
```

Then, visualize this with springs: 

```{r mean-springs}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, color = "red") +
  geom_segment(x = xbar, xend = xbar,
               y = 1/2,  yend = N + 1/2,
               linewidth = 3) +
  geom_spring(aes(x = x, xend = xbar,
                  y = y, yend = y,
                  tension = tension,
                  diameter = diameter),
              color = "blue",
              linewidth = 1.2) +
  labs(x = "Value (x)",
       y = "Observation number") +
  ylim(0, N+2) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:N) +
  annotate("text", x = xbar, y = N + 1,
           label = "Movable\nrod", size = 5,
           , lineheight = 3/4) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

## Bivariate centroid

For a bivariate sample, $(x_i, y_i)$, the centroid point, $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ is realized physically as the result of attaching
springs between the fixed points and a free, movable point. If we make the tension on the spring proportional to it's length
or the distance to the centroid,
each point will have potential energy proportional to its **squared** distance
from the movable one, where the forces balance (sum to zero).

Set this up for a sample of 10 points, uniformly distributed on (1, 10).
```{r cent1}
set.seed(1234)
N <- 10
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(N, 1, 10),
  y = runif(N, 1, 10)
)

means <- colMeans(df)
xbar <- means[1]; ybar <- means[2]
```

Set the tension as the distance between the point and the mean:

```{r cent2}
df <- df |>
  mutate(tension = sqrt((x - xbar)^2 + (y - ybar)^2),
         diameter = 0.4)
```

Visualize the springs:

```{r centroid-springs}
ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, color = "red") +
  geom_spring(aes(x = x, xend = xbar,
                  y = y, yend = ybar,
                  tension = tension / 5,
                  diameter = diameter),
              color = "blue",
              linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(x = xbar, y = ybar, 
             size = 7,
             shape = 15,
             color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:10) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) 
```

### Animate this?

One way to animate this would be to imagine the springs acting one at a time, sequentially on the position of the moving point, and looping until nothing changes. Not sure how to program this with `gganimate`.
